// Q2: Using the same tree that you made insert the values 6,7,8 accordingly. Now check if the tree
// made is a complete binary tree or if itâ€™s a full binary tree if not delete the nodes accordingly, to
// make it a complete and full binary tree. (I know the tree will be complete but implement a logic
// to check if it is complete).
